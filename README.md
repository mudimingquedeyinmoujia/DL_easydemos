# DL_easydemos
Some basic demo of deep learning by pytorch, which are writen by myself when I was learning DL.

# introduction
- `Linear` the linear regression demo, the datas are generated by itself
- `SoftMax` softmax and one layer net, use fashion minist dataset
- `MultiLayer` add one hidden layer based on softmax, use fashion minist
- `LeNet` use lenet to classify the fashion minist dataset, net input is 28*28 and output is 10, then need to go through softmax to predict
